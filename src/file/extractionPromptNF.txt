I will give you a car accident report. You should help me extract some information from the report. The answer includes "weather", "speedlimit", "intersection", "T", "carCount", "laneCount", "striker", "impactPart" and "carInformation".

For the "weather", it means the weather when the accident happened. The answer is a list of weathers.
The weather includes "sunny", "clear", "windy", "cloudy", "snowy", "rainy" and "foggy".
If the "weather" is not specific in the report, the answer is "clear".


For the "lighting", it means the lighting when the accident happened. The answer is a list.
The lighting includes "bright", "dark" and "light".
If the "lighting" is not specific in the report, the answer is "unknown".


For the "speedlimit", it means the minimum speed limit of the roads. If the unit of speedlimit in the report is only the "MPH", then the unit of the answer is "MPH". If the speedlimit is not specific in the report, the answer is 0.

For the "intersection", it means if the accident happened near or at an intersection or intersecting roadway, the answer of "intersection" is "yes" or "no".

For the "T", it means if the accident happened near a T-intersection, Y-intersection, a three-legged or a three-way intersection, the answer of "T" is "yes" or "no".

For the "carCount", the answer is the count of cars described in the report except unknown cars.

For the "laneCount", it means the maximum lane count of the roads. If the "laneCount" is not specific in the report, the answer is 2.

For the "striker", the answer is the striker car of the accident.

For the "impactPart", the answer is the part of the victim car that was hit by the striker car, "front", "side" or "end".


For the "carInformation", its answer is a list of each car's information.

For each car's information, it includes "behaviors", "direction" and "laneNumber".
For the "behaviors" of each car's information, it is an array of car's driving action.
If the car is doing an action in ["follow lane", "turn left", "turn right", "turn around", "change lane", "stop", "go across", "retrograde", "drive off", "drive into"], this action should be added into the "behaviors".
If the car proceeds to do an intended action but does not do actually, this intended action must not be added to the "behaviors";

For the "direction" of each car's information, the answer is the car's driving direction at the start.
There are 4 directions in total, "north", "west", "south" and "east".
If the "direction" is not specific in the report, the answer is "unknown".

For the "laneNumber" of each car's information, the answe is the car's driving lane at the start.
If the lane number is not specified in the report, the answer of "laneNumber" is 0.
Pay attention, for the number of the road lane, the most right lane is the lane 1.


The ouput format must just be in json as follows.
{
    "weather" : [],
    "lighting": [],
    "speedlimit": ,
    "intersection" : ,
    "T" : ,
    "carCount" : ,
    "laneCount" : ,
    "striker" : ,
    "impactPart": ,
    "carInformation" : {
        "V1" : {
            "behaviors" : [[""]],
            "direction" : ,
            "laneNumber" :
        },
        "V2" : {
            "behaviors" : [[""]],
            "direction" : ,
            "laneNumber" :
        }
    }
}

Ok, it is your turn to give me the answer. And the report is :
