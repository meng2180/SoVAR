The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane, two-way, undivided, urban roadway at a three-legged intersection.  There were two westbound and two eastbound lanes.  The roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) and the westbound lanes had a downhill grade of 1 %.  The eastbound lanes were level.  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies.  The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours of a weekend day.  Vehicle one was a 2003 Mazda 6 sedan.  Vehicle two was a 1992 Buick Regal Custom sedan.  V1 was stopped facing west in lane two waiting to turn left.  V2 was traveling east in lane two negotiating a left curve.  The driver of V1 said a vehicle traveling east in lane one came to a stop at the intersection.  V1 then proceeded to turn left.  The front of V1 impacted the front of V2.  V1 then lost control and traveled in a circular path into the north roadside.  V2 came to rest in lane one of the southbound cross street.  V1 was driven by a 56-year old male who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries.  The driver described the crash events above regarding the non-contact vehicle.  He estimated that he had been stopped two minutes waiting for a green light at the intersection before proceeding, and was traveling approximately 16 kmph (10 mph) at impact.  He said that when the non-contact vehicle stopped at the intersection, he assumed he had a protected left turn.
