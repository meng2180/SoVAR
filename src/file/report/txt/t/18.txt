	V1, a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup, was traveling eastbound on a three-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions.  V1 was approaching a T-intersection intending to turn right.  V2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling southbound on a four-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway approaching the same intersection.  V2 was intending to go straight.  The posted speed for both roadways was 89 kmph (55 mph). Eastbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign; south and northbound traffic had no traffic control device. V1 stopped at the stop sign for 10 seconds or more.  V1 then made a right-hand turn.  The front of V2 contacted the left of V1 before they both came to final rest in the roadway.	The driver of V1 was a 68-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to the store.  He did not wear corrective lenses.  He was uninjured in the crash and refused treatment.  	The Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning right at intersection.  The Critical reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a recognition error: inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see) because he stated that he had looked both ways but did not see V2.
