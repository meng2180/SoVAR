There are no traffic controls for the east/west roadway and a stop sign is posted for the intersecting northbound travel direction.  The posted speed limit on the east/west roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph).Vehicle one (V1) was a 1997 Infinity Q45 that was traveling west and negotiating a curve to the right.

Post impact V1 rotated clockwise and departed the north side of the roadway and the front of V1 impacted an embankment where it came to rest.  After the first impact V2 deflected to the right and departed the south side of the roadway and came to rest facing east on the upslope of an embankment.
