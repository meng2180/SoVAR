The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction and a one-way roadway with one lane of travel.  The roadway was straight and level, and had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device; the southbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. It was dark but lighted, and clear with no adverse conditions.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Lexus SC430 traveling eastbound on the two-way roadway and Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Lexus LS400 traveling south on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right side of Vehicle #2.  The front of Vehicle #1 then impacted a light-pole on the southeast corner of the intersection.  The Lexus SC430 (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 45-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 ran the stop sign and caused him to impact Vehicle #2 and then into the light-pole.  He stated that he did not perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The Lexus SC430 was towed due to damage.
