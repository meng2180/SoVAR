      The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an intersection controlled by a traffic control.  Conditions were cloudy and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph).     V1 was a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV traveling in the first travel lane approaching the intersection controlled by a traffic signal intending on going straight.  V2, a 2000 Sterling A9500 M/H truck, was stopped at the intersection with a red traffic control signal.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 69-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  The driver of V1 refused to be interviewed.  V1 was towed due to damage.
