     The crash occurred in the middle of the intersection of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were dark with lights and dry in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 40 kmph (25 mph).     V1 was a 2005 Toyota Matrix hatchback traveling westbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 2005 Hyundai Accent coupe, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection with a stop sign.  V2 did not stop at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the intersection.  V1 then rolled 6-quarter rolls and came to final rest on its roof facing eastbound.  V2 came to final rest facing northwest.     V1 was driven by a 31-year-old male who was transported with moderate injuries to a local hospital prior to our arrival.  V1 was towed due to damage.  The driver stated that he was traveling through the intersection and the other car just drover through the stop sign, she didn't even slow down.  Driver of V1 gave a partial interview in the ambulance, but would not respond to numerous attempts to contact him via both landline and cell phone.
