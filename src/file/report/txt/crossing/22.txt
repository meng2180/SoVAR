This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekend in the intersection of a northbound one-way roadway and a two-way east and west roadway.  All roadways were straight and level and had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  The northbound entrance into the intersection was controlled by a stop sign.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.V1, a 1998 Mercedes-Benz ML320, was traveling westbound approaching the intersection.  V2, a 1999 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling northbound and stopped at the stop sign.  As V2 proceeded into the intersection, its front impacted the left side of V1.  V1 than yawed counterclockwise and the right-rear wheel impacted the curb.  The right side of V1 then impacted a breakaway light-pole and rolled over one quarter turn before coming to final rest on its right side.V1 was driven by a 35 year-old male who sustained minor injuries and was transported to a medical facility.   A complete interview could not be obtained, but the driver stated that he was going straight when he was impacted by V2, who did not stop at the stop sign.  The Mercedes-Benz was towed due to damage.
