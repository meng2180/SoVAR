	This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon in an intersection between two, two lane undivided, bituminous roadways.  The East/West roadway was dry and straight with a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55mph) and a -2% grade.  This roadway had a black on yellow intersection warning with flashing yellow beacon with a suggested speed of 72kmph (45mph) prior to the intersection.  The North/South roadway was a dry, level roadway with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph) and was controlled by a stop sign.  There was also a flashing signal, yellow for the main roadway and red for the cross street.  	V1, a 1993 Chevrolet Prizm, was stopped in the northbound lane for the stop sign and flashing red beacon.  V2, a 2001 Jeep Wrangler, was westbound approaching the same intersection.  V1 entered the intersection and was struck in the right side by the front of V2.  V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side struck the left side of V2.  V2 continued forward a short distance, struck a light pole with its front and came to rest facing west.  V1 continued off the right side of the roadway and swiped an 80 cm diameter tree with its right side.  V1 than struck a 120 cm diameter tree with its front and came to final rest facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.      	V1 was driven by a belted 20year-old female who was transported, treated and released for minor injuries.  The driver could not be located or contacted for additional information.  She did state to the police that she did not see V2 coming when she proceeded into the intersection.
