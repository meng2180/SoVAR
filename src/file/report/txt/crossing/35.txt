The posted speed limit was 35 MPH and both roads were level.     V1 was a 2002 Mazda 323 hatchback traveling northbound in the right lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.

V1 came to final rest facing northeast.  V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male who was not injured.
