     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a three-lane roadway with a median controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight with rain in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH) with a -2% downhill grade.     V1 was a 1990 Honda Civic sedan traveling southbound in the second travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal.  V2, a 1999 Chevy Silverado pick-up, was stopped in traffic in the southbound lane in front of V1.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2 in the southbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     V1 was driven by a 18-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she was talking to her friend and did not realize how close she was to V2.  She then braked and swerved right but struck V2 in the rear.  V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 KMPH (31 and 40 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.
