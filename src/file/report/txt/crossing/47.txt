     The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were dark with minimal lighting in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).  The northbound lane had a  >2% uphill grade.  The southbound lane was level.     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Corolla sedan traveling northbound in the third travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2006 Chevy Colorado pickup, was traveling southbound in the 2nd travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.

The driver did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.
