     The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane roadway separated by a raised curb median (two lanes each direction) at an intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  Conditions were daylight with clouds in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 MPH).  The westbound lanes had a negative 2 percent slope.     V1 was a 2004 Chevy Cavalier sedan traveling around a jug-handle intending to turn left at the intersection with the east/west roadway.  V2, a 2002 Buick Century sedan, was traveling westbound in the left lane intending on continuing straight through the intersection with a green traffic control signal.  The driver of V1 stated that she stopped for a red traffic signal, and when she thought that her light had changed to green, she entered the intersection. The front of V1 struck the right front side of V2.  V2 was deflected to the left and onto the grass median where the front of V2 struck a traffic control signal post.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast and V2 came to final rest facing southwest.  A witness that was identified on the police report as traveling to the right of and behind V2 indicated that the traffic signal for westbound traffic had been green. The county's highway department reviewed the tripped curcuit and verified that traffic on the jug-handle (V1) had a red light.     A 41-year old female drove V1 and was not injured.  She stated that she was traveling around the jug-handle intending on turning left at the intersection with a possible green traffic control signal when V2 struck the front of her vehicle.  The driver of V1 did not have time to take any avoidance actions.  V1 was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.
