There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  Vehicle one (V1) was exiting a parking lot, which had a gradient of +2.  Vehicle two (V2) was going straight on a level roadway, passing the parking lot from where V1 was exiting.  There were no traffic control devices present at the location of this crash.    V1 a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee was attempting to make a left onto the westbound roadway from a parking lot from a convenience store.  V2 a 1992 Chevy Cavalier was traveling east on the main roadway at approximately 64kph (40mph).  The front left of V2 made contact with the left rear of V1.  The impact caused V1 to spin counter clockwise before coming to final rest in the westbound lane.  V2 continued further ahead before coming to rest in between lanes one and two of the roadway.   Vehicle two was removed from the scene due to moderate damage, whereas vehicle one suffered minor damage and was removed by the owner.
