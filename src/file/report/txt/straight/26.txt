This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight with a downhill grade of -2/61.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.  The speed limit for the roadway was 48kmph (30mph).  On the right of the southbound lanes was a gas station and a carwash. Vehicle # 1 was a 1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT, that was traveling southbound on the right lane.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1996 Ford Windstar that was traveling northbound on the left lane and attempting to turn left into the Gas Station.  Due to a sightline restriction from a non-contact vehicle, the front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the right-front wheel of Vehicle # 2.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was driven by a 40-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 25 mph when a mini-van traveling northbound attempted to make a left-turn.  The driver stated that he tried to brake but it was too late because his sightline was restricted by another vehicle on the left-lane.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was not towed due to damage.
