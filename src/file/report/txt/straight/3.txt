There were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was dark but lighted with normal traffic flow.V1, a 2000 Mazda 626, was traveling north in lane one when its left side was contacted by V2, an unknown type van, as it re-entered the roadway from the shoulder. The initial impact caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle and began to swerve off the road to the left.  She drove a few feet up the embankment on the side of the road digging her left side tires into the grass/dirt causing them to blow out and damage her undercarriage.  V1 abruptly steered right descended down the hill and began to rollover. V1 re-entered the roadway still turning clockwise and rolled over two quarter turns onto its top coming to final rest facing south.  V2 continued traveling and didn't stop.V1 was driven a 25-year old female in good health on her way home.  She stated she didn't expect a vehicle (V2) to be traveling on the shoulder.  When she finally saw V2 encroaching from the left shoulder into her lane. Both driver and passenger were transported to the hospital with moderate injuries and V1 was towed due to damages.
