       The crash occurred in the left lane of a level two-lane roadway with a concrete median barrier (4 lanes total).  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 MPH).     V1 was a 1996 Chevy S10 pickup truck traveling southbound in the left lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2005 Nissan Quest minivan, was traveling southbound directly in front of V1.  V2 was stopped when the front of V1 struck the rear of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     A 17-year old male drove V1 and was not injured.  Both driver and parent of the driver refused to be interviewed.  V1 was driven away from the scene.
