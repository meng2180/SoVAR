     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a curve right.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph).     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Rav 4 SUV traveling westbound in the right lane negotiating a curve-right.  V2, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee SUV, was traveling eastbound in the right lane negotiating the same curve.  V1 drifted across the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northbound.     V1 was driven by a 50-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  She stated that she was very upset due to recent news about her mother who was ill.  The driver drank two beers and continued to drive when her vehicle drifted across the centerline and struck V2.   V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage.
