The north/south roadway has three lanes; each direction consists of one through lane and a left turn lane. The speed limit on these roadways is 56 kmph (35 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Ford Mustang, was eastbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Honda Accord, was southbound in lane one. In the intersection, the front of V1 struck the right side of V2. V1 was towed due to damage.The driver of V1, an eighteen-year-old male, was traveling from a park to a tow yard to pick up parts for his vehicle. He was well rested and healthy, although he had just been running in the park for one-and-a-half hours (which he does three times each week), and admitted that he felt exhausted. This driver stated that he was "zoning and trying to catch my breath" just prior to the crash and did not realize that his signal was red until he was almost into the intersection. He applied the brakes and skidded into the intersection.
