This two vehicle collision occurred early evening on a two-lane on-ramp of a state highway.  The eastbound on-ramp is one-way, dry, asphalt, and has a -4% downgrade slope.  A green/red signal controls the flow of on-ramp traffic unto the east/west state highway.  The on-ramp's number one lane is designated a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane.  The highway is designated a 104 kmph (65 mph) zone.  Vehicle one (V1) is a 1998 Toyota Camry, four-door sedan, driven by a nineteen (19) year old female with two passengers was traveling eastbound in the number two lane.  Vehicle two (V2) is a 2005 Ford Expedition, sport utility vehicle, driven by a forty three (43) year old male with one passenger was traveling eastbound in the number two lane.  As V1 traveled on the on-ramp her cell phone rang, while the driver of V1 looked for it,  V2 had stopped in travel lane.  The front plane of V1 contacted the rear plane of V2.  Both vehicles came to rest facing eastbound in their original lane.  V1 was driven to the side of the on-ramp with major damage.  V2 was driven from the scene with minor damage.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded:  other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.  The critical reason was assigned to V1 as a driver related factor:  internal distraction.  The driver was focused on retrieving her ringing cell phone, and failed to look forward.
