This two-vehicle crash occurred in a three-legged, intersection with no traffic control. The roadway was straight and level and consists of two lanes in each direction and a left turn lane. The speed limit on this roadway was reduced to 40 kmph (25 mph) due to the construction in the northbound lanes. Traffic barriers reducing the lanes to one southbound and northbound lane separated the two southbound lanes. The traffic barriers created a sight line restriction for both directions of travel. The cross street is used to access a shopping mall. This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Volkswagen Passat  4 door sedan with two occupants, was northbound and stopped for about 2 seconds to turn left.
