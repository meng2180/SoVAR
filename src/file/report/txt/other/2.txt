	The single car, midweek, early afternoon crash occurred on the west side of an urban, straight, level, bituminous, 2 way, 2 lane roadway with a bike lane on each side.  The roadway had a posted speed limit of 48kmph(30mph).  At the time of the crash the roadway was dry, it was daylight and the weather was clear.	V1, a 2004 Honda Accord solely occupied by a 72-year-old female driver, was northbound on the roadway described above.  A 20-year-old female pedestrian was walking northbound in the southbound bike lane.  V1 drifted left over the centerline and continued to its left.  The front of V1 hit the back of the pedestrian.  The pedestrian was carried on V1's hood until V1 exited the roadway to the left.  V1's front then struck a tree located between the street and the sidewalk.  The pedestrian was thrown forward approximately 13 meters and landed in the southbound bike lane.  V1 rotated to the right and came to rest against the tree facing west.  Both the driver of V1 and the pedestrian were injured and transported.  V1 was towed due to damage.	The driver of V1 stated that she was northbound, traveling the speed limit and moving along with traffic.  She was not in a hurry, just had lunch at a friend's house and was on her way home.  She then doesn't remember anything until V1 hit the tree.  She didn't even know that she had hit a pedestrian until she saw a crowd around something in front of her car.  After she was transported she was kept in the hospital for 2 days undergoing tests but nothing was found to explain her time lapse while driving.  Witnesses state that at no time did she appear unconscious or asleep.  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1 as well as two witness interviews.
