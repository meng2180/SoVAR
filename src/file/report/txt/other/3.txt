	V1, a 1996 Dodge Stratus, was traveling westbound on a five-lane undivided dry asphalt roadway during the mid-evening hours. It was dark out, but the roadway was illuminated intermittently by streetlamps.  The roadway had two lanes in each direction with a center flush (painted) median that was used for left turns in both directions. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).	V1 was driven by a 16-year old male. He was traveling in the second lane when he came upon a slower-moving non-contact vehicle. He looked over his right shoulder to make a lane change to the right, and then changed lanes into the first lane of travel. As soon as he completed the lane change, he saw a pedestrian in all black walking in front of him, from left to right.  He applied his brakes full-force but could not stop in time.  The front of V1 contacted the right of the pedestrian. This impact knocked the pedestrian up into the air and the pedestrian landed on the right side of the windshield, breaking it. The pedestrian then fell on the roadway in the first lane of travel. The driver of V1 brought his vehicle to a controlled stop in lane one.	The driver of V1 reported that he had been traveling between 67-80 kmph (41-50 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to the occupant's house.  He does not wear corrective lenses.  He was uninjured and refused treatment.
