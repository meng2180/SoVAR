This two vehicle daytime collision occurred just past noon on a five lane, undivided, dry, level, roadway made of asphalt. The east/west roadway is designated 56 kmph (35 mph). Vehicle one (V1) is a 1993 Ford Probe 2-door hatchback, driven by a forty four (44) year old female.  V1 was exiting a parking space to traveling east, from  the south curb to the number one lane. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer 4-door compact sport utility, driven by a thirty (30) year old female who was traveling east in the number one lane.  V2's front plane impacted V1's left plane as V1 attempted to enter the roadway. V1 continued southeast to impact a guy wire, a block wall, and a small brick planter with its front plane. Simultaneously, V1 contacted a power pole with its left plane. V2 continued northeast and came to rest facing east in the number two lane. V1 was towed with moderate damage. V2 was driven with moderate damage.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on left side of travel lane.   The critical reason for the critical event was assigned to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (i.e. failed to look, looked but did not see).  The driver said she looked over her left shoulder to check for traffic before merging into the number one lane from the parking lane.  She never saw V2 prior to impact.  The driver had just attended a meeting across the street and was on her way home.
