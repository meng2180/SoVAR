A single-vehicle versus pedestrian collision occurred a few hours after noon during daylight hours.  The collision occurred in an intersection crosswalk on a busy two-way, seven-lane divided roadway, in southbound lane two.  The pre-crash roadway is a slight uphill grade, and straight with bituminous paving.  The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph).     	Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevy Cavalier, was traveling southbound in lane two.  V1 entered a four-leg intersection on a green light and the driver was observing a bus just past the intersection.  As V1 traveled through the intersection, the driver did not see the pedestrian until he was right on his windshield. The pedestrian was running across the intersection heading westbound in the crosswalk toward the bus.  The pedestrian had just veered off of the crosswalk in a southwest direction when V1 impacted him. During the impact his body wrapped against V1 and his head impacted the windshield on the passenger side.  The driver of V1 had applied the brakes and the pedestrian was thrown southbound and came to rest under the stopped metro bus. V1 was towed due to damage.
